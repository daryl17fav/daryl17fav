 Hey there 👋🏽 I’m Daryl — your go-to software engineering babe who’s all about fusing creativity, clean code, and that boss-level energy into every project I touch 👩🏽‍💻✨

🧠 I’m a Computer Science grad + lifelong learner, constantly exploring new frameworks and turning wild ideas into beautiful, functional products. From building UI-rich web apps with HTML/CSS/Flutter to diving deep into Vue.js & Laravel, I’m always leveling up my tech stack and my vision.

🌍 I thrive at the intersection of code and design — where logic meets aesthetics. Think responsive layouts, smooth animations, intuitive UX, and pixel-perfect details. I love when code *feels* like art.  

🛠️ Tools of the trade:
- 💻 Frontend: HTML, CSS, Flutter, Vue.js (currently learning!)
- 🛠️ Backend-ish: PHP, SQL (CRUD baddie alert)
- 🎨 Design: UI/UX focus, obsessed with clean visuals + meaningful interactions
- 🚀 Projects: Enoteexam, trip management systems, CRUD platforms & more!

🌱 My tech journey is just getting started, but trust me — I’m not just here to play around. I’m here to build, to lead, to innovate, and to glow while doing it.

📚 I’m curious to the core, always asking “why” before “how,” and constantly finding ways to merge what I *love* with what the world *needs*. Whether it’s studying new libraries, teaching others, or building side projects just for the vibes — I’m always learning and sharing.

👑 Future goals? 
- Become a Software Architect / Tech Lead
- Build apps that solve real-world problems (especially for education & community impact)
- Create a tech lifestyle brand for girls in code 💻✨
- Keep breaking stereotypes and entering rooms I wasn’t “expected” to be in

🤝 Let’s collab, code, and create something powerful.
